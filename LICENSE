   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 11 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
      
      "Digital File" shall mean a computer resource for recording data 
      discretely in a computer storage device. Just as words can be written 
      to paper, so can information be written to a computer file. 
      A Digital File must be designed to store a picture, a written message,
      a video, a Computer Program, or a wide variety of other kinds of data
      which has sense and it is useful in some way.
      
      "Image" shall mean specifically any image, video, graphical content,
      or any file which contains vector image content, used on the project, 
      as Object or as Digital File. Image is an artifact that depicts visual 
      perception, for example, a photo or a two-dimensional picture, that has
      a similar appearance to some subjectâ€”usually a physical object or a 
      person, thus providing a depiction of it. In context of image signal 
      processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).
      
      "Image File" shall mean a codded Digital File which builds an Image 
      content or Image artwork. Image Files are standardized means of 
      organizing and storing digital images. Image Files are composed of 
      digital data in one of these formats that can be rasterized for use on 
      a computer display or printer. An image file format may store data in 
      uncompressed, compressed, or vector formats. Once rasterized, an Image 
      becomes a grid of pixels, each of which has a number of bits to designate 
      its color equal to the color depth of the device displaying it.
      The file extensions included on this definition are defined on the 
      following lists in these website pages: 
      "https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/raster_image", 
      "https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/video", 
      "https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/3d_image", 
      "https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/vector_image".
      
      "Computer Program" shall mean the collection of instructions that 
      performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires
      programs to function. 
      
      "Computer Programming" shall mean the process of designing and building 
      an executable computer program for accomplishing a specific computing 
      task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, 
      profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the 
      implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly 
      referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or 
      more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a 
      sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task for 
      solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires 
      expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the 
      application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
      
      "Programming Work" shall mean specifically all files that contains text,
      codding work, contains Computer Programming information or is a Computer 
      Program. Programming Work definition does not include Image content, does 
      not include Image as Object or as Digital File, does not include files 
      that contain text which in someway builds an Image File, does not 
      include all Image File formats that exist and all Image Files that will 
      exist in the future. 

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You, a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Programming Works 
      of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Programming Work and such Derivative Programming Works in Source or 
      Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Programming Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. 
      If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Programming 
      Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Programming Work
      constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
      licenses granted to You under this License for that Progamming Work 
      shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You, a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, irrevocable copyright license to
      merely use, reproduce, prepare Derivative Image Works of,
      download, the Image Work and Image Files and such Derivative Image
      Works in Source or Object form. Distribution, publicly displaying, 
      publicly performing, sublicensing, and selling the Image Work and
      such Derivative Image Works in Source or Object are constituents of 
      crime and such responsibility is taken from the moment that You 
      commit one or more of those actions.
      
   5. Patent License isn't granted for Image Works and Image Files that you
      can find on the project.

   6. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Programming Work or Derivative Programming Works thereof in any medium, 
      with modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided 
      that You meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Programming Work or
          Derivative Programming Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Programming 
          Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Programming Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Programming Works; and

      (d) If the Programming Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
          its distribution, then any Derivative Programming Works that You 
          distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution 
          notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those 
          notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative 
          Programming Works, in at least one of the following places: 
          within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative 
          Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along 
          with the Derivative Programming Works; or, within a display generated 
          by the Derivative Programming Works, if and wherever such third-party 
          notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
          informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add
          Your own attribution notices within Derivative Programming Works that You
          distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the 
          Programming Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot 
          be construed as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   7. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   8. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   9. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  10. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
